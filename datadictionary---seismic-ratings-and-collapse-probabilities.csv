Building Nbr,Text,Building Number,Unique Building Number assigned by OSHPD Facilities Development Division to a seismically separate building on a hospital campus.
Building Name,Text,Building Name,Building name provided to OSHPD by the Facility.
Building Status,Text,Building Status,"Statuses include ""In Service"" for buildings that are currently in use and ""Under Construction"" for buildings currently under construction.  Other statuses are used to identify buildings that may be located in general acute care facility but do not provide general acute care services."
SPC Rating,Text,SPC Rating,"Seismic ratings for the building's primary structure are expressed as a Structural Performance Category; SPC ratings range from 1 to 5 with SPC 1 assigned to buildings posing significant risk of collapse following a strong earthquake and SPC 5 assigned to buildings reasonably capable of providing services to the public following a strong earthquake. Where SPC ratings have not been verified by the Office of Statewide Health, Planning and Development (OSHPD), the rating index is followed by the letter 's'.  N/A = Not Applicable and  NYA = Not Yet Available."
2007 Hazus Score (%),Numeric,2007 Hazus Score (%),"The Multi-Hazard Loss Estimation Technology (HAZUS) program is used to determine the Probability of Collapse of the building; expressed as a percentage, this number reflects the likelihood of the building to collapse when ground motions of a given design acceleration occur at the building site - 2007 version."
2010 Hazus Score (%),Numeric,2010 Hazus Score (%),"The Multi-Hazard Loss Estimation Technology (HAZUS) program is used to determine the Probability of Collapse of the building; expressed as a percentage, this number reflects the likelihood of the building to collapse when ground motions of a given design acceleration occur at the building site; the 2010 version uses additional building parameters to determine the collapse probability. Buildings located directly on faults are assigned probability of -50%."
OSHPD NPC Rating,Text,OSHPD NPC Rating,"Seismic ratings for anchorage and bracing of the building's architectural, mechanical, electrical systems, components and equipment are expressed as a Nonstructural Performance Category; NPC ratings range from 1 to 5 with NPC 1 assigned to buildings where the safe and orderly evacuation following a strong earthquake cannot be assured and NPC 5 assigned to buildings capable of continued operation for 72 hours without any power, water and sewer services following a strong ground motion.    N/A = Not Applicable and  NYA = Not Yet Available."
